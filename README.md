Data used in this manuscript are available by request (too large to host on github): email Keith (khengen@wustl.edu) or Sam (sbrunwa@wustl.edu) for a link. Once you've downloaded the data, clone the git repo and unzip the data into the data folder (there's .txt file in that folder explicitly guiding you do to this). Then go nuts.

## Installation
```

Enter these commands in terminal:

    conda create --name appps1 python=3.10 --no-default-packages
    conda activate appps1
    pip install -r requirements.txt


Additionally, unzip data into the 'data' folder.
```
